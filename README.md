- 👋 Hi, I’m @mauriziobotto75
- 👀 I’m interested in developping software
- 🌱 I’m currently rewrite old experience in JAVA, .NET, Visual Basic, Cobol or ABAP/4 (at the moment I have added the code developped during the experience at Techne Informatica s.r.l. and Chi-Group) because I want to add this to my CV for Italian ITC Company interested to work with me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developping software with JAVA or .NET or ABAP/4 for this moment.
- If you are an ITC Company you can contact me by e-mail (mauriziobotto75@gmail.com)
